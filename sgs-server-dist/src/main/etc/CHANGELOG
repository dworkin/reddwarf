Version 0.9.10:
- Add DataManager.getObjectId (issue #99) and
  DataManager.getBindingForUpdate (issue #120)
- AppListener no longer extends ManagedObject (issue #108)
- Split internal API classes used to write custom services, transports,
  protocols, and authenticators into a separate sgs-server-internal-api.jar
  file (issue #162)

  started, allowing services to use services that are started after them
  (issue #145)
- Add a locking AccessCoordinator and add a configuration option for
  specifying the access coordinator (issue #138)
- Update license to GPLv2 + classpath exception.  The classpath exception
  has been applied to all classes in the sgs-server-api and
  sgs-server-internal-api modules.  The other modules remain as pure
  GPLv2 (issue #164)
- Also fix issues #5, #32, #44, #48, #61, #73, #82, #89, #98, #109, #113,

Version 0.9.9:
- Add pluggable client session protocol and transport layers (issue #26)

    "delivery requirement") in the classes ClientSession,
    ChannelManager, and Channel. 
  - Add method ClientSession.send(ByteBuffer, Delivery).
  - Add method Delivery.supportsDelivery(Delivery).
  - Add new exception class com.sun.sgs.app.DeliveryNotSupportedException.
  - Removed APP_PORT property, replaced in part, by transport specific
    property. Use com.sun.sgs.impl.transport.tcp.listen.port to set the
    port of the (default) TCP transport. Otherwise the port will default
    to 62964.
