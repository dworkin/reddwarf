RedDwarf Server Distribution
Version ${sgs.version}

INTRODUCTION

RedDwarf lets developers write scalable, reliable, persistent
and fault-tolerant game server applications using simple
single-threaded, event-driven code.

This distribution of the RedDwarf Server contains everything you
need to develop game servers that run as applications in the RedDwarf
Server environment.  Information about building client
applications is available as separate downloads.

In addition to the documents, APIs and examples, this distribution
contains a complete single-system version of the RedDwarf
Server.

See the CHANGELOG file for a summary of recent changes, and the RELEASE
COMPATIBILITY section below for information about compatibility.

SUPPORTED PLATFORMS

This distribution has been tested on the following operating systems and
processors:

- Solaris(TM) 10 Operating System on SPARC processors and AMD 64-bit
  processors
- Windows XP SP2 on 32-bit processors
- Redhat Linux EL4 on 32-bit processors
- Mac OS X 10.5 on Intel processors

This distribution requires Java(TM) Platform, Standard Edition 6 (Java
SE platform 6), or greater.

It has been tested with version 1.6.0_12 of Java SE platform 6 on
Solaris, Windows, and Linux platforms, and version 1.6.0_07 on Mac OS X
platforms.

REQUIRED LIBRARIES

The RedDwarf server depends on several additional libraries.

This distribution requires Berkeley DB version ${bdb.version}, which may be
bundled with this distribution, or else can be obtained and compiled
from:

  http://www.oracle.com/database/berkeley-db/db/index.html

This distribution supports Berkeley DB Java edition version
${bdb.je.version}, which may be bundled with this distribution, or else
can be obtained from:

  http://www.oracle.com/database/berkeley-db/je/index.html

DEVELOPING AND RUNNING

The RedDwarf server can be started up using the executable bootstrapper
JAR file in the bin directory.

  java -jar bin/sgs-boot.jar

The RedDwarf server can be shutdown using the executable stopper JAR
file in the bin directory.

  java -jar bin/sgs-stop.jar

RedDwarf is an application container in which applications (or games)
can be deployed.  By default, any JAR files that are placed into the
deploy directory are considered part of the deployed application.
Additionally, a single application JAR should contain an embedded 
META-INF/app.properties file.  This file is automatically used by the 
RedDwarf server to set the runtime configuration properties of the
application.

For example, to deploy the Hello World tutorial application into the default
RedDwarf container, copy the tutorial.jar file from the tutorial 
directory into the deploy directory.  Then bootup the server using the 
executable bootstrapper described above.

Additional customization of the location of deployed applications and runtime
configuration files is possible.  See the configuration files located in the
conf directory for additional details.


RELEASE COMPATIBILITY

Release 0.10.2:

- The default BerkeleyDB implementation used is now set to the BerkeleyDB
  Java Edition.  This conflicts with the previous default of the BerkeleyDB
  Native Edition.  If upgrading a live instance of RedDwarf with existing
  persistent data, the BDB_TYPE property in the conf/sgs-boot.properties
  should be set to db to use the old default of BerkeleyDB Native Edition.

Release 0.10.0:

- The persistent data stored by the ChannelService is incompatible with
  the previous releases.  The ChannelService's persistent data created
  using releases prior to 0.10.0 will not be automatically upgraded to the
  current release format.

- The ClientSessionService implementation can be configured to support
  clients of the latest SimpleSgsProtocol version (5), and by default
  supports clients of the previous version (4).  All clients connecting to
  the server must be the same version (either 4 or 5).  The protocol
  version can be specified with the following property (which defaults to 4):

  com.sun.sgs.impl.protocol.simple.protocol.version

Release 0.9.10:

- The persistent data stored by the ChannelService is incompatible with
  previous releases.  The ChannelService's persistent data created using
  releases prior to 0.9.10 will not be automatically upgraded to the
  current release format.

- The AppListener interface no longer extends ManagedObject.  AppListener
  classes with mutable state should now explicitly implement ManagedObject.

Release 0.9.9:

- The com.sun.sgs.app.port configuration property is no longer supported.
  See the CHANGELOG and API-CHANGES files for a complete description of 
  the new pluggable client session protocol and transport layer.
  Applications written for previous releases should use the
  com.sun.sgs.impl.transport.tcp.listen.port configuration property in
  place of com.sun.sgs.app.port.

Release 0.9.7:

- Running an application using release 0.9.7 with persistent data
  created using release 0.9.6 will automatically upgrade the data to the
  current release format, which is incompatible with earlier releases.

- The following configuration properties were changed incompatibly:

  com.sun.sgs.impl.kernel.profile.level
  com.sun.sgs.impl.kernel.profile.listeners

Release 0.9.6:

- See the API-CHANGES file for a detailed list of changes to the API in
  this release.

- Does not support persistent data from earlier releases.


KNOWN ISSUES

This version of the RedDwarf Server has the following
limitations:

- Multi-node operation is currently not scalable.  Depending on the
  application, adding additional application nodes to a multi-node
  cluster may reduce performance, not improve it.  We expect this
  behavior to improve in future releases.

- This release supports only limited I/O throttling, so it is possible
  for clients to overwhelm the server with network traffic and cause the
  server to run out of memory.  As a temporary workaround, developers
  must ensure that clients do not send network traffic faster than the
  server application can process it.

- The API for customizing managers and services is incomplete and still
  under development.

- The transaction coordinator implementation does not support more than
  one persistent service at a time.  This restriction prevents using
  additional services that modify the contents of databases.
