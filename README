Project Darkstar Example C Client

INTRODUCTION

This directory contains example code for developing clients in the C
programming language that can communicate with the Project Darkstar
Server.


CONTENTS

- chatclient
  Source code for a simple chat example

- sgs
  Source code for the example C client implementation

- test
  Source code for tests


BUILDING

Unix:

- Ensure that the files etc/sgs.mk and etc/$(UNAME).mk
  contain appropriate settings for your platform.

- Invoke GNU make at the top level:
    % make
  or
    % gmake

- To build the tests:
    % cd test
    % make

- To build the chat client example:
    % cd chatclient
    % make

Windows:

- Ensure that the appropriate compiler tools are available in
  your %Path%.  See env.bat for an example.

- Ensure that the files nmake.mak and etc/nmake.mk contain
  appropriate settings for your platform.  In particular,
  you may need to adjust the paths to the compiler includes and
  libraries in etc/nmake.mk.

- At the top level, invoke nmake.exe:
    > nmake.exe /F nmake.mak

- To build the tests:
    % cd test
    % nmake.exe /F nmake.mak


RUNNING TESTS

- After building the tests (see above), the resulting test
  executables can be run manually.  For example, on Unix:

    % cd test
    % ./buffer_test

  ...and so on with the other test executables.
  

KNOWN ISSUES

This example has the following limitations:

- The Windows implementation is incomplete; the networking code
  needs to be ported to the Winsock2 API.
