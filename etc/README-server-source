Project Darkstar Server Source Distribution
Version @VERSION@

INTRODUCTION

Project Darkstar lets developers write scalable, reliable, persistent
and fault-tolerant game server applications using simple
single-threaded, event-driven code.

The Project Darkstar Server Source Distribution contains the source code
for developing game servers that run as applications in the Project
Darkstar Server environment.  Information about building client
applications is available as a separate download.

In addition to the documents, APIs and examples, this kit contains the
source code for a complete single-system version of the Project Darkstar
Server.  The APIs in this version are the same as those that will be
included in the full-scale, multi-node version of the system, which will
be released in the future. The current system allows development of
games that run on a single server. The server system will make use of
the multi-threading capabilities of that server when they are available.

CONTENTS

This distribution contains the following subdirectories:

- doc
  Server tutorial

- etc
  Miscellaneous files for building the source code and for running the
  server

- example
  Source code for example games

- lib
  An empty directory for installing third party JAR files

- src
  Source code for the server implementation

- test
  Source code for tests

BUILDING

The Project Darkstar Server makes use of several other open source
projects.

To build the software, you should install and use Ant:

- Apache Ant, version 1.6.5 (or better):

  http://ant.apache.org/

You can use the build-server, jar-server, and javadoc-api-server targets to
build the server classes, JAR file, and documentation.

The JAR files for the following two projects need to be installed in the
lib subdirectory:

- Apache MINA, version 1.1:

  http://mina.apache.org/downloads.html

- Simple Logging Facade for Java (SLF4J), version 1.4:

  http://www.slf4j.org/download.html

The binaries for Berkeley DB are also needed:

- Berkeley DB, version 4.5.22:

  http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/berkeley-db/db/index.html

These binaries need to be installed in a directory that you specify as
the value of the bdb.lib.dir property when using Ant.

The JAR file for the Junit project needs to be installed in the lib
subdirectory in order to run the tests:

- JUnit version 4.1 (or better)

  http://junit.org/index.htm


KNOWN ISSUES

This version of the Project Darkstar Server has the following
limitations:

- It only supports single node operation.

- I/O throttling has not been implemented in this release, so it is
  possible for clients to overwhelm the server with network traffic and
  cause the server to run out of memory.  As a temporary workaround,
  developers must ensure that clients do not send network traffic faster
  than the server application can process it.

- It does not support pluggable I/O transports.

- The API for customizing managers and services is incomplete and still
  under development.

- The transaction coordinator implementation does not support more than
  one persistent service at a time.  This restriction prevents using
  additional services that modify the contents of databases.
