Version 0.9.12
 - Included missing test files testCallbacks.h and README.txt in distribution

Version 0.9.11
 - Changed the channel name from a wchar_t* to a char*

Version 0.9.10
 - Fixed a number of bugs in the handling of throttling and in logout,
    these deal with the root causes of issue 13.
 - Changed the data structure used in the login for connection.c to
    use h_addr_list[] rather than the deprecated hostent; this fixes
    the root cause of issue 12.
 - Added the chat client example; this partially addresses issue 14
 - Added a smoke test client, which can be run against a server to test
   all of the protocol messages that flow between the client and the server
 - Added functions sgs_connection_get_context() and sgs_connection_get_session()
   which remove the requirement that the client keep shadow copies of the
   context and session objects in order to access those objects
 - Added function sgs_ctx_create_empty(), which creates a context with no
   callbacks filled in. This removes the special nature of reg_fd_cb and
   unreg_fd_cb.
